# ‘Wee Radish God’ Is Here To Work Its Magic!

Could the Woolbeast ‘Wee Radish God’ be the cutest food figure ever? Warning: do not eat!
From the artistic hands of
Melissa Stanley
, the creator behind the
Woolbeast
universe, comes
Wee Radish God
! The eagle-eyed amongst you may be having a serious case of deja-vu, because
Wee Radish God
is indeed a re-release from back in March.
There is no question over the fact that the Radish is extremely cute, from the beady black eyes to the tiny mouth. But adorableness aside, the sculpt also packs a lot of detail! We particularly love the painting aspects and various color tones to give each Radish a realistic look!
Stanley invests a lot of time and care into creating each
Wee Radish God
. In fact, every step is done by hand from the casting to the painting and sewing. Something quite special to the Woolbeasts is the combination of the resin sculpture and the wool leaf sprouts. Talk about a mix of textures!
Wee Radish Army!
But that is not where Melissa’s hard work ends. Each sculpture is part of the Woolbeasts world and has its own story that can be read on
the
Woolbeast
website
! There is a lot of dedication to create the personalities of each figure and the world she has built.
The Wee Radish God …is a small God.
Generally, they’re not much “god” of anything, except the rough patch of ground that makes up the Treehouse Garden.
Since they’re a wee god, they can work wee miracles. Because they’re only wee miracles, they’re mostly garden-related.
They are peaceful, and speak rarely. When they do speak it is short and simple, quiet Truth.
What a thing, to be tied to the Cosmos, and completely content with a wee patch of dirt in the Forest.
