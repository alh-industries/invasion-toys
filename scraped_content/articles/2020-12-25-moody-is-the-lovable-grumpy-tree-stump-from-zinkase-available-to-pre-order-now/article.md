Zinkase’s ‘Moody’ may hate people, but you will love him!
Moody
, the once majestic maple has been ‘suffering humans since forever’ in the new art toy by
Zinkase
. However, you may be able to turn his frown upside down!
Moody
has a predominantly monochrome color scheme until you open him up to reveal the vibrant pinky-red sap from within! This contrast works brilliantly for the quirky premise.
Moody
has various striking features to truly make him catch your eye, from the stump body to the sap hair to the detachable protruding bone. Even though this maple stump may have a grumpy expression, you certainly cannot help but smile.
Zinkase Moody In Hands Open
This year has been a hard one, but illustrator Zinkase has taken it in stride to fulfil his long time goal of creating his first art toy.
Moody
is actually based on an illustration the artist did in 2016. In fact, Zinkase is already working on a second toy, so stay tuned!

Each figure is hand casted by special effects makeup artist,
Marcos Sagasta Mora
, and hand painted by Zinkase.
The toy measures 12.5cm x 10cm and is made of resin with a semi-matte coating. Zinkase notes that
Moody
can double up as a box due to the lid!
Moody
will cost 120€ plus shipping and is available directly through
Zinkase
! The toy will be shipped in March 2021. Be quick, this maple stump is a limited edition of 10 pieces!
