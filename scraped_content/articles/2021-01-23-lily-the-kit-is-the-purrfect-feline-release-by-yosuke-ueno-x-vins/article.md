Yosuke Ueno is teaming up with VINS to bring you
Lily The Kit
!
Yosuke Ueno
‘s latest sculpture release,
Lily The Kit
, is bound to steal your heart! The artist continues to bring his art characters to life as adorable sculpts. This time, it’s
Lily The Kit
‘s time to shine! A collaborative effort between Ueno and
VINS
, the production company has done an extraordinary job of replicating the
Lily The Kit
fans know and love.
The big innocent eyes are a spitting image of those we have seen in the artist’s previous works. The pastel pink dress completely backs up the innocent sweetness of the piece which will make for a perfect addition to the collection of
Lily
fans. The fluffy tail tops off the figure! It even has a magnet in it, so you can change its angle. This is such a great touch and really brings some extra charm to the already appealing piece!
Yosuke Ueno’s art has captivated a dedicated fanbase with the fascinating characters, ranging from cartoonish styles to realism. Now, Ueno is continuing to delve into the designer toy realm to bring his characters off the page!
The artist was drawing original characters even back in early childhood. Ueno’s art tends to focus around innocence and symbolism merged with his original characters. The general feel-good theme around his work is described as “Love, Space and Positive Energy.”
Lily The Kit
will come signed and numbered by Yosuke Ueno and VINS. It is made of poly-resin and fluff on the tail, and is limited to just 100 pieces worldwide.
The figure measures 26cm x 19.5cm x 16cm and comes in a protective wooden box. The package will weigh approximately 4.2kg.
Lily The Kit
will cost $480 and ships in the second week of February. It will go on sale
directly from VINS
on January 29, 11pm Taipei time (January 29, 9am CST).
