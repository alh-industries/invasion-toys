Yoii is a New Zealand-based visual artist with a prodigious talent and years of hard word. She first came on to the designer toy scene around 2015, and has since put out spades of incredible art. Her style is unmistakable, and though we wished would firehose-blast us with nonstop drops, there’s a certain magic to her rare-release style.
OG collectors will no doubt recognize Yoii from previous iterations of Kidzilla and Gameragirl, or perhaps from 2015’s
Pugrider
, the grail of all grails. And if you aren’t familiar, today is your lucky day. Feast your eyes on the glory that is
Pugrider

Kidzilla x Gameragirl
is Yoii’s latest art toy set to join the fray. This troublesome twosome comes together in a single release that features all-new sculpts by Wetworks’ divine hands.
Kidzilla and Gameragirl come fully decked out in hand-painted digs and golden weapons. They are fully resin, measure 7.5 inches tall, and might just be tired of each other’s sh*t.
