WheresChappell
‘s new
Lone Wolf
and
Lone Wolf and Cub
resin figures are impressively detailed renditions of
The Mandalorian
’s star bounty hunter,
Din Djarin
, with (or without) baby
Gorgu
in tow. WheresChapell, the artist behind
Mahalo Cabin
, was inspired by the concept art from
The Mandalorian
, the first of many planned
Star Wars
spin-off series.

When
The Mandalorian
was first announced it received mixed reactions. There are still those who refuse to see it based on their initial reaction to the concept of a live-action
Star Wars
television series, but there are very few who have given it a watch and not left a fan. With an incredible story, stellar characters, and stunning visuals, it’s earned its place in the galactic hall of fame.
A look at some of the incredible concept art for the Mandalorian.
The
Lone Wolf and Cub
figures pay intricately accurate and artistically excellent tribute to
The Mandalorian
. The figures stand at just over 22.5cm, include incredible details like satchels and weapons, and are hand-painted in a variety of pallets.
Lone Wolf and Cub
includes baby Gorgu slung across
Mando
‘s back, while
Lone Wolf
comes without the added baggage.
Lone Wolf
will be available in five variants:
BOBA
,
KENNER
,
MANDO
,
HOLIDAY
, and
CONCEPT
Lone Wolf
variants (left to right): BOBA, KENNER, MANDO, HOLIDAY, and CONCEPT
Pre-Order will open at 8PM UK time (2PM CST) on November 29th. They are expected to finish production in March 2021.
