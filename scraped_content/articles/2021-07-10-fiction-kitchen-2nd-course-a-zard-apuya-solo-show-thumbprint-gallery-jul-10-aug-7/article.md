Picking up right where he left off

Carrot cake from Bridesmaids

Normally, Zard Apuya will build his pieces on top of
Dunnys
and
Munnys
, but in this show, all the pieces are sculpted from the bottom up.  This helps to create such realistic pieces that your friends may try to eat them off your shelves!
Apuya has hit fandoms from all over, with
Deadpool’s
Chimichanga
to the carrot cake from
Bridesmaids
and everything in between. Hopefully you all arrive hungry!
